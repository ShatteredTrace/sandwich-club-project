# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview
This project shows you the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help you to better understand how it is processed.

## What did I Learn
- How to submit projects for review
- Hot to parse JSON to a model object
- How to design an activity layout
- How to populate all fields in the layout accordingly
